Title overrides for Discord activities
---

This directory contains custom configuration for titles. The default configuration for all other titles is in [src/discord/titles.ts](../titles.ts). This is used by [src/discord/util.ts](../util.ts) (which also declares the type for title configuration objects) to convert znc presences to Discord activities.
